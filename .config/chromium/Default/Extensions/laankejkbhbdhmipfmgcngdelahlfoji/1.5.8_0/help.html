                    <h3>What is StayFocusd?</h3>
                    <p>
                        StayFocusd is an extension for Google Chrome that helps you stay focused on work by restricting the amount of time you can spend browsing time-wasting websites.
                        Once your allotted time for the day has been used up, the sites you have blocked will be inaccessible until the next day.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="faq">
                    <h3>Why do I need StayFocusd?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Because you're human. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You sit down at the computer, and you swear you'll be productive. Next thing you know, it's twelve hours later. You've checked your email,
                        updated your Facebook status, browsed the trending topics on Twitter, read your RSS feeds, looked up your favorite band on Wikipedia, vanity googled yourself, 
                        cyber-stalked your ex, your ex's lover, and several high-school crushes, and lost a week's pay playing online poker.</p>
                    <p>
                        What you haven't done is <i>WORK.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact is, it's very hard to stay focused on work or school when you have all the world's information, news, music, and *cough*porn*cough* at your fingertips. 
                        Sometimes self-control is in short supply, and you need a little help keeping on track.

                <li class="faq">
                    <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
                    <p>
                        StayFocusd adds an icon to your browser, to the right of the address bar. Clicking it will display a popup window with one primary option:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Block this entire site:</b> This will block you from browsing <i>any page</i> on the current site once time runs out. For example, if you block cnn.com, it
                                will block all pages on cnn.com, www.cnn.com, politics.cnn.com, www.cnn.com/some-article-title, etc. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                        You can also click Advanced Options to expose more specific options for blocking and allowing the domain. Let's use politics.cnn.com as an example:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Allow this entire site:</b> This will allow you to browse every page on the current site, even after time runs out.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Only block pages on politics.cnn.com:</b> This will prevent you from browsing <i>only</i> pages on the current subdomain. 
                                If you block politics.cnn.com, you will still be allowed to browse sportsillustrated.cnn.com, as well as www.cnn.com and cnn.com.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <i>NOTE: </i> If you only block www.cnn.com, you will still be able to access cnn.com ... which kind of defeats the purpose of blocking the site.
                                This option should only be used to block subdomains other than www. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Only allow pages on politics.cnn.com:</b> This will allow you to browse pages on the current subdomain, even if the rest of the domain is blocked.
                                For example, you may want to block yourself from the entire cnn.com website <i>except</i> politics.cnn.com. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Enter a custom url:</b> This will allow you to block or allow any specific page, path, or query. For example, you may want to block yourself from Google Reader,
                                at google.com/reader. Entering this custom url and clicking "Block custom url" will block your access to google.com/reader without preventing you from accessing
                                any other Google url for search, email, docs, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Likewise, you can use the custom url to allow only a specific path while preventing access to the rest of a domain. For example, you may choose to block the
                                entire Delicious site at delicious.com. However, if you want to use Delicious to bookmark a site, you'll need to allow access to delicious.com/save. Entering
                                delicious.com/save into the custom url field and clicking "Allow custom url" will let you use Delicious for bookmarking while still blocking other delicious.com pages.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </li>

                    <h3>How do I enable StayFocusd in Incognito mode?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Click Chrome's Wrench icon (top right, below close button), then Tools > Extensions. Look for the StayFocusd extension, and check the "Allow in incognito" checkbox.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Is there any way to remove the ability to disable/uninstall the extension?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, no. Chrome extensions can not remove the disable or uninstall options. I do have a request in to the Chrome developers to add this ability, but I don't expect them to implement my request (ever).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, you CAN prevent yourself from accessing the extensions settings page by adding chrome://extensions to your Blocked Sites list. Once your time is up, you won't be able to access the settings to disable StayFocusd.

                    <h3>Can you make this extension work for other browsers? Is there a version for my phone? Can it block desktop software or other Chrome apps?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I wish. Chrome extensions only work in Chrome -- they can't affect any other software, browsers, devices, or Chrome apps/extensions. If you find yourself using other browsers to cheat, your best bet is to uninstall them. Or you can delete the shortcuts from your desktop, quick start, start menu, etc. Making it more inconvenient to boot up another browser may help curtail the urge to cheat.

                    <p>
                        You can disable the update notice in the Customize section of the <a href="options.html#customizeTab">Options</a> page.

                    <p>
                        Nope. All StayFocusd tracks is which sites are in your blocked/allowed sites lists, and the amount of time you have spent on them for the day. All of this data is stored on your local computer -- absolutely nothing is transmitted off your computer.

                        Sure, as long as your time for the day hasn't run out yet. Just visit the <a href="options.html">Options</a> page and enter the number of minutes per day you want to allow yourself. 
                        If your time has run out for the day, you'll have to wait until tomorrow before you can update your settings.

                    <p>
                        Clicking the StayFocusd icon in your browser will open a popup window with a display of the amount of time you have left for the day.
                        If you are currently on a blocked site, the timer will actively count down how much time is remaining. If you're on an allowed site, or a 
                        site which is neither blocked nor allowed, then the countdown will be paused.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When your time is almost up, a small countdown timer will appear superimposed over the StayFocusd icon. It will count down the last 60 seconds, first
                        with a yellow background, then turning red when you're down to the last 30 seconds.

                        Once you use up your allotted time for the day, you will not be able to access any of the sites you have blocked. If you try to access a blocked site,
                        you will be redirected to the StayFocusd website, where you will be made to feel very guilty for trying to waste time when you should be working.

                        Your allotted time will be reset once per date, at the Daily Reset Time. If you use up all your time early in the day, then you'll have to wait until the Daily Reset Time passes before you can browse

                        At some point you probably clicked the "Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs" checkbox on one of the popups StayFocusd displays when you change your time. Try closing all Chrome windows, then restart Chrome. That should fix the issue.

                        of the Active Days. (There is not currently a way to set different hours for different days.)

                    <h3>What is the Daily Reset Time?</h3>
                    <p>
                        StayFocusd gives you a limited amount of time per day to browse blocked websites. Once per day, the timer is reset, and your Time Remaining countdown is restored.
                        The Daily Reset Time allows you to customize the time that this reset happens.

                    <p>
                        It depends on your work/sleep habits. By default, the Daily Reset Time is set to midnight. However, if you're a night owl who works well past midnight, you may not want your timer to reset right in the middle of 
                        a productive late night. In that case, you can set the timer to reset in the very early morning, like 5:00 AM.

                    <p>
                        The delay is there to prevent you from using the Daily Reset Time to cheat. If the setting took effect instantly, you could easily set the reset time to one minute after your Time Remaining runs out, therefore
                        allowing continued access to blocked sites.

                        This can sometimes happen if your Daily Reset Time is between your Active Hours (i.e. your Active Hours are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and your Daily Reset Time is 4:00 PM.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To solve this problem, set your Daily Reset Time to a time after the end of your Active Hours. Using the example above, setting the Daily Reset Time to 5:01 PM would solve the problem.

                    <p>
                        The Nuclear Option is a way for you to block access to the entire Internet (optionally excluding your Allowed Sites) for as many hours as you specify. You can set it to start immediately, to kick in once you have exceeded your Max Time Allowed, or to start at a scheduled time. It can be set to run just today, every week day, or every single day. It can block entire sites, or just selected content: multimedia, forms, logins, and/or images.

                <li class="faq">
                    <h3>What are some good ways to use the Nuclear Option?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The most obvious use is to help you stay focused when you have a deadline approaching, whether it's a project for work, a homework assignment, a school test. Set the Nuclear Option for several hours starting right now, and all your attention can go towards the task at hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It can also help people who find themselves staying up way too late goofing around on the Internet instead of sleeping. Set the Nuclear Option to kick in for a few hours every day around your bedtime, and you can break yourself of the late-night web surfing habits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're the type of person who loses a lot of time playing games on Facebook or watching videos on sites like YouTube or Hulu, blocking multimedia will prevent you from accessing that content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're the type who obsessively checks email, reads Facebook messages, or posts in forums or blog comments, blocking forms can help break you of that habit. Or you can just block logins, which will prevent you from entering a password on any sites that require a login. If you can't log in, you can't waste time there.
                    </p>

                        You can't. That's why it's called the Nuclear Option. Once you push that button, there's no turning back. You have to wait until the hours you entered expire.

                        That depends. If you want to change the settings to make the Nuclear Option more restrictive (i.e. going from blocking just your blocked sites to blocking all sites), then yes.

                    <p>
                        It's completely unrelated. The Nuclear Option is typically used in special circumstances outside your normal day-to-day workflow, so it goes by its own rules.

                        Well, the most obvious way is by seeing sites being blocked. You can also tell by the StayFocusd icon, which will turn into a yellow "radioactive" icon when the Nuclear Option is active. Also, the timer in the StayFocusd popup will read "nuclear."

                        If you set the Nuclear Option to start at a specific time, then you will get a desktop notification 5 minutes, 1 minutes, and 10 seconds before the Nuclear Option starts blocking sites.

                    <p>
                        StayFocusd blocks img tags, which is what most sites use for images. However, some images -- such as the thumbnails in Facebook photo galleries -- are displayed using the background-image css property. Blocking that requires processing that could slow down some websites, so I'm letting those slip.

                    <p>
                        StayFocusd has to wait until the page finishes loading before looking for images to block. Some sites load more slowly than others, resulting in a small lag between the image being loaded and StayFocusd being able to block it. I'll keep looking for ways to make this faster though -- it might be possible to find a clever solution.

                        If you minimize the browser or switch to another program, StayFocusd will continue to deduct from your allotted time for up to 5 minutes. If there is no activity in your browser -- no typing and no mouse movement -- after 5 minutes, then the

                        When you return to the site after being away, you can clear the overlay by clicking a link or pressing any key. At that point, the countdown will resume.

                    <p>
                        The Stalker Option is designed to follow you when you visit links clicked from blocked sites. Sites like Reddit, Feedly, and RSS readers are notorious time-wasters, and blocking them doesn't do much good. The problem is, you don't waste a lot of time on the sites themselves. Instead, you waste time visiting the sites they link to. You might spend 5 minutes on Reddit, and 5 hours on sites you clicked from there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Stalker Option solves this problem by keeping your countdown running whenever you're visiting sites via links from blocked sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if you have Reddit blocked, and you click a link to Wikipedia from there, time will be deducted while you're on Wikipedia ... even though Wikipedia isn't a blocked site. And if you click a link from Wikipedia to yet another site, the timer will <i>still</i> keep running. As long as your click path ultimately leads back to a blocked site, time will be deducted.

                    <p>
                        Just visit the <a href="options.html#blockedSitesTab">Options</a> page and uncheck the box in the Stalker Option sidebar. You can't disable this option once your Max Allowed Time has been exceeded for the day.

                        Just visit the <a href="options.html#customizeTab">Options</a> page and check the "Never show infobar" box under Customize Infobar.

                    <p>
                        If you have the Stalker Option activated, your countdown will continue counting down whenever you're on a site that you reached by clicking a link from a blocked site.

                    <p>
                        In general, StayFocusd is designed to prevent you from changing your settings to give yourself more time. However, if you really want to make it hard on yourself,
                        you can turn on the <a href="options.html#requireChallengeTab">Require Challenge</a> setting to block easy access to the settings altogether.
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <h3>What is the "difficult, but not impossible" challenge?</h3>
                    <p>
                        When Require Challenge is turned on, you will be required to type a short paragraph into a text box. The catch is, you must type it perfectly, letter-for-letter, from start to finish, without making a single mistake.
                        That means no typos, no backspace, no delete, no cut-and-paste. If you mistype even one letter, the whole thing blanks out, and you have to start over.

                    <p>
                        When the Require Challenge overlay appears, look in the lower right corner for a link that reads, "I want to change settings so I can be more productive". Clicking that will let you access a limited subset of options -- only those which will limit your browsing more, not less.

                    <p>
                        You can, but your custom text must be at least as long as the default challenge text. It must also be sufficiently complex -- you can't just enter a long string of "aaaaaaaaaaaaa" and expect it to work. To customize the challenge, visit the <a href="options.html#requireChallengeTab">Options</a> page.
