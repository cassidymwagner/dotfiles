                        <li>Fixed: Setting Nuclear Option for time that already passed (but not by more than the number of hours to block) set expiration time to current time + block length instead of start time + block length.</li>

                        <li>You can now set StayFocusd to be active only during selected hours. This allows you to, for example, restrict your browsing during the hours you're supposed to be working, while allowing unrestricted browsing during your free time.</li>
                        <li>Added an optional challenge that must be completed before changing any settings. When this is active, you will be required to complete a difficult -- but not impossible -- challenge before you are allowed to access the options page.</li>

                        <li>You can now set StayFocusd to be active only during selected days. This allows you to, for example, turn it off on weekends.</li>
                        <li>Added the Nuclear Option, which allows you to block access to ALL websites for a certain number of hours.</li>

                    <h4>Bug fixes</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clear "still there?" overlay when switching tabs back to blocked site. If you clicked to switch tabs, you're obviously there. The previous version presumed this and started the countdown again, but left the overlay visible (which implied that the countdown was still paused).</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed: "Still there?" message displaying on allowed subdomains or paths for domains which are otherwise blocked.</li>
                        <li>Fixed: "Still there?" message reappears too soon again after it is cleared.</li>

                    <h5>January 31, 2010</h5>
                    <h4>New features</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Added activity monitor to keep track of when the user is active and inactive on a site. If the user is inactive on a blocked site for a protracted period of time, the site is visually blocked with an overlay, and the StayFocusd countdown is stopped.</p>
                            <p>Before this feature was added, if you were on a blocked site and you minimized the browser, switched to another program, or walked away from the computer, the StayFocusd countdown would keep running. That could result in you using up all your time even when you weren't actively using the blocked site.</p>
                            <p>The addition of this feature means that you will only use up your allotted time when you're actually active on a blocked site (meaning you are typing or your mouse is moving).</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Removed unneeded logging to reduce memory consumption.</li>
                        <li>Removed "allow this entire site" from popup. It's not really useful, but it IS an invitation to cheat by allowing a blocked site just before time runs out.</li>

                        <li>Fixed: Issue with timer not resetting at midnight. The date check only happened when the browser was opened, so if you left it open overnight, it wouldn't reset until you closed and re-opened. Now it checks every time you load a page or switch a tab.</li>

                        <li>Fixed: Zero or negative numbers should not be allowed in the max time allowed settings.</li>
                        <li>Fixed: Allow numbers from keypad to be used in max time allowed settings.</li>
