# dotfiles
Dotfiles for arch setup. 

My poor attempt at keeping track of them, which I probably should have been doing since the beginning.

* Lol hit the road `pywal`. Not really enough customizability and I felt like I had to choose my wallpaper too carefully.
* Using `Goyo` with `vim` is the best decision I've made in awhile.
* `Asciiquarium` is stupid fun.
* Also `compton` is pretty distracting.
* Also also I changed the font to `adobe source code pro`.

* Started learning how to use/customizing `vim`
* Started using `tmux`: not sure how often I'll use it in conjunction with `i3`, but it seems nice, so we'll see.
