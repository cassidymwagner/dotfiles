# dotfiles
Dotfiles for arch setup. 

My poor attempt at keeping track of them, which I probably should have been doing since the beginning. 

#### TODO
* Try a different bar sometime
* Get jedi-vim to work
* ~~Figure out why I can't use adobe source font in the status bar~~ Fixed

* Lol hit the road pywal. Not really enough customizability and I felt like I had to choose my wallpaper too carefully.
* Using Goyo with vim is the best decision I've made in awhile.
* Asciiquarium is stupid fun.
* Also compton is pretty distracting.
* Also also I changed the font to adobe source code pro.

* Started learning how to use/customizing **vim**
* Started using **tmux**: not sure how often I'll use it in conjunction with i3, but it seems nice, so we'll see.
